# Microbe-classification-network
I used a kaggle dataset which included information about various types of microgranisms, it included 24 predictors and a class variable which had 10 different classes in it. I chose to use a neural network because in this particular case i felt that explainability was not important so a neural network would do nicely. I also wanted to gain some experience implementing multiclass classification models using the softmax activation function. After training the network it achieved an accuracy of 93%. This network could be used to produce preliminary classification of microorganisms before lab tests are complete. Data link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sayansh001/microbes-dataset
